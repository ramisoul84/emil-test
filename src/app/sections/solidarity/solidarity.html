            I dedicate part of my work to supporting initiatives that fight for dignity and equality. A portion of each
            project goes to organizations such as Sea-Watch (rescue at sea), Pro Asyl (migrant rights), Queer Refugees
            Deutschland, and Fridays for Future. I’m also glad to collaborate directly with NGOs and grassroots groups
            who need design and storytelling support, feel free to reach out.
